These are \nstudied theoretically/analytically and are then illustrated by means of computer -based simulation. In \nparticular, the following topics are studied: methods for generating random variables from statistical \ndistributions, Monte Carlo integration, Markov chains and Markov c hain Monte Carlo methods (including \napplications to Metropolis -Hastings and Gibbs sampling methods), homogeneous and non -homogeneous \nPoisson processes and variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo integration.  \n Prerequisite pass modules:   \n\u2022 Mathematical Statistics 312  \n\u2022 Mathematical Statistics 316  \n\u2022 Mathemat ical Statistics 344  \n\u2022 Mathematical Statistics 364  \nHome department: Statistics and Actuarial Science Economic and Management Sciences \n241"
