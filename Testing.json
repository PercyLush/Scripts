The use of these techniques will also be extended to explore the nutrition status of communities in alignment with other modules. Students will develop the ability to demonstrate and interpret basic measures of non-invasive physical fitness and routine screening methods (urine analysis, finger-prick blood glucose, hemoglobin and cholesterol tests, vital signs). Additionally, the recording and analyzing of a patients diet history and screening procedures for malnutrition are introduced, as well as the use of a web-based dietary program.

Ethical principles and universal ethical theories that apply to the nutrition and health care environment are explored, as well as the application in practice. Ethical rules and regulations according to the HPCSA are discussed, and the appropriate professional conduct of a nutrition professional. The various categories of human rights will be explained. The concept of a human rights-based approach to health is explored, as well as the concept of the right to adequate food, and its value for human development, food security and poverty reduction programs. The state obligations and the responsibilities of individuals and other role players in society to further the realization of human rights is explored. The application of human rights in South Africa is examined in view of the relevant institutions. The role of the South African Constitution pertaining to the realization of the right to health, water and adequate food in various situations and amongst vulnerable population groups are investigated.

Various aspects of multivariate statistics are discussed. Students learn mathematical theory supporting multivariate statistics, and the application of these statistics. The consequences of the assumptions made on multivariate statistics are also considered. In particular, the following topics are studied: the characterisation and display of multivariate data; matrix algebra and random vectors; the multivariate normal distribution; inferences about the multivariate population mean vector.",

The work must be performed under the direct supervision \nof an engineer from an appropriate discipline. Students are required to, within their engineering discipline , \napply  fundamental engineering principles to solve practical problems in an industrial context and develop \ntheir technical and interpersonal skills.

To this end, students are introduced to global and public health nutrition (PHN) with specific emphasis on the role of the nutrition professional in primary health care (PHC) by foregrounding a human rights-based approach. Furthermore, students gain understanding of key concepts such as the relationship between nutrition, education, lifestyle and health promotion. Students also relate the principles of communication, including intercultural communication, effective instruction, planning outcomes and content selection to the role of the nutrition professional. Once these principles are grounded, the global and local nutrition landscapes are introduced, with a focus on malnutrition in all its forms, its extent, causes and consequences, while also presenting the global and local evidence-based interventions to address malnutrition within an enabling environment framework. Students are also introduced to the link between the social, economical, environmental and commercial (trade) determinants of health and its impact on nutrition by gaining insight in the political economy of nutrition and the need for nutrition policy.",

The student will integrate knowl edge and experience gained from all \nprevious modules and apply th is to a data -rich research topic. Students will have the opportunity to \nsynthesise what they have learned and apply that knowledge to new, complex situations. Students must  \nengage in the enti re process of solving a real -world data science problem, from collecting and processing \nactual data, to applying suitable and appropriate analytical methods to the problem , and communicating the\nresults in a clear and comprehensive way.\nMathematical Statistics  \nStudents who wish to take programmes in Mathematical Statistics are required to take and pass Probability \nTheory and Statistics 114 or 144, as well as Mathematics 114, 144 in their first year of study. This grants \nadmission to Mathematical Statistics 214. Please note that the module Probability Theory and Statistics 114 is \noffered to BSc students in the first semester by the \nStatistics 144 in the second semester by the \nStatistics",

Biological invasions are widely recognised as one of the main\nthreats to both the conservation of biodiversity, and the maintenance of ecosystem services worldwide. In\nmany parts of the world, the most challenging and time-consuming tasks of conservation biologists and\nmanagers are those relating to controlling alien species and preventing impacts, and, increasingly, repairing\nsystems already damaged by aliens. The interaction between invasions and other drivers of global change\ncreates fascinating areas for research.\nThe aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the exciting and important field of \ufffdinvasion science\ufffd\nthe full spectrum of fields of enquiry that address issues pertaining to alien species and biological invasions.",

Different approaches to biography as an academic genre or\nmethod are juxtaposed. This module also highlights important figures and currents from Christian history that\nare not covered in detail in the earlier years of study.",
