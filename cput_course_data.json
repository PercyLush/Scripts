To grasp the basic principles of data transmission which also includes computer \nnetworking application s and networking protocols, for example routing, switching and int er-process communication it \nis important that students are exposed to the various elements and components of digital communications. This \nincludes transmission Control Protocols (TCP) as app licable to the transmission of data. \nTo achieve this the courses i s structured to include the following basic principles: \n- Ethernet and the telephone system. \n- Data transmission media. Optic fibre; Radio waves; Microwaves; Infrared and Laser; Coaxial cables ( thin and thick) \nand twisted pair cables such as CAT1, CAT2, CAT3, CAT4, CAT5 and CAT6. \n- Partitioning the problem. Abstraction, service versus implementation; layering as a restricted form of abstraction. \n- Transmission fundamentals. Physical channel; limitati ons: noise, attenuation. Channel capacity (bandwidth). \nModulation techniques for digital systems. \n- Coding. Modulation as a form of coding, A/D, D/A, error correcting and detecting codes. \n- Multiplexing. FDM, synchronous and asynchronous TDM. Circuit switching , packet switching, ATM. \n- Switching and routing. Repeaters, bridges , routers and switches. \n- LAN, MAN and WAN. LAN topologies and technologies. \n- Protocols and state. ARQ and X.25 as examples. \n- Naming, addressing and routing. \n- The Internet architecture, TCP, IP, UDP, ARP, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF, IPv4 and IPv6. \n- Communication and netwo rking: ISO 7-layer reference model, TCP/IP. \n- Network management: security, firewalls and quality of service. \n- Wireless and mobile computing. GSM, cell layout, frequency planning, mobile station, base station systems, \nswitching sub systems. \n- Mobility Managemen t, Signalling protocols, MS-PSTN call, PSTN-MS call, MS- MS call, call handover. \n- Functioning and types of PSTN networks, encryption, Characteristics of SIM, equipment identification. \n- SS7 versus SS7 over IP, Physical layer, data link layer,  MAP Protocols.",

    "Description": "System analysis is conducted for the purpose of studying a system or its parts in order to identify its objectives. It is a \nproblem solving technique that improves the system and ensures that all the components of the system wo rk efficiently \nto accomplish their purpose. Analysis specifies what the system should do . A system is therefore an orderly grouping \nof interdependent components linked together according to a plan to achieve a specific goal. A system must have \nthree basi c constraints: \n- A system must have some structure and behaviour which is designed to achieve a predefined objective. \n- Interconnectivity and interdependence must exist among the system components. \n- The objectives of the organization have a higher priority than the objectives of its subsystems. \n \nThe analysis of a system is thus a combination of the Processor and the Control element. Finally, the behaviour of a \nComputer System is controlled by the Operating System and Software. In order to keep system in balance, what and how \nmuch input is needed is determined by Output Specifications. The subject Systems Analysis combines most of the \nsubjects listed in this course and to interface all these concepts and to be able to analyse a system an understanding \nof the fol lowing content us required: \n \n- Structured analysis, object-oriented analysis and agile methods. \n- SWOT analysis, system feasibility study and preliminary system investigation. \n- Scheduling tools, including Gantt charts and PERT/CPM charts. \n- Task dependencies, dur ations, start and end dates. \n- Functional decomposition diagram (FDD), Unified Modelling Language (UML) symbols, fact-finding techniques \nand total cost of ownership. \n- Data and process modelling concepts and tools. Object modelling terms and concepts. \n- When to use the various outsourcing o ptions. Interface design. Generating user reports. \n- Entity relationship diagrams, normalization, topologies and architectures. \n- Software quality assurance and software engineering. \n- Risk management concepts. Backup and disaster re covery systems. \n- Financial, co mmercial, legal and socio-economic impact of a system.",
